# The project is Free And Open-Source
Elite is an open-source platform tailored for luxury hotel room reservations, providing an inclusive space for users to effortlessly discover and book premium accommodations. Our system operates under the MIT License, emphasizing transparency and accessibility. Elite invites everyone to indulge in the world of opulence by designing their own bespoke stays at some of the finest hotels. Whether you're a traveler seeking exclusive experiences or a hotelier looking to showcase your luxury offerings, Elite is the collaborative hub for elevated hospitality.

# Looking around Other Similar Projects
We conducted our own research to identify projects that were comparable to and competitive with ours before launching an open-source project. Here are links to some comparable websites:
https://github.com/AhmedHussain12345/Hotelbookingwebsite
https://github.com/OurWebProject/hotelwebsite
https://github.com/Allenpatt/hotellbiru
https://github.com/kjy4926/HotelReserve
https://github.com/mohammadaliraei/HotelReserve

Our main goal was to enable users—travelers and hospitality enthusiasts in particular—by offering a smooth platform for finding and reserving opulent lodging all over the world. We wanted to serve a wide range of customers, including business and leisure travellers as well as those looking for unique travel experiences. Our goal was to provide a carefully chosen range of high-end hotels and resorts while simultaneously improving user accessibility and convenience. Our goal was to develop a user-friendly UI and extensive functionality that would make booking easier and improve our users' travel experience in general.


# Choosing a Good Name
One of the challenges we as a team had was coming up with an appropriate name for the open-source project before it was launched. The project name should convey not only its uniqueness but also a general understanding of its purpose. The project name must also be unique from other projects' names and simple to recall.

We collectively agreed to vote on the names LuminaLodge, Elite, CitadelStays, and InsightStay to choose a suitable name. And collectively, we made the decision to go with the name "Elite" because it is short, memorable, and distinctive. We also conducted our own investigation to look through all the repos and discovered that there aren't many results using this name.


# Starting from What You Have
The creators' ambition is reflected in the transformation of the Elite Web Application into an open-source platform that is available to everybody. Elite has evolved significantly from its initial conception as a project for the ITCS 333 Internet and Web Development course. It is now essential to reorganize the coding to guarantee cross-platform compatibility.

# Developer Guidelines

Welcome to the community supporting Elite development! The purpose of these guidelines is to facilitate your effective participation in the project. Before you begin working on Elite, please review these a bit. 

### Developers’ Interaction

The documents and guidelines of the community must be followed by every member. 

It is recommended that developers connect via Microsoft Teams or email. 
These are not hard regulations, but rather guidelines. They seek to enhance collaboration, optimise our process, and provide advantages to our goods as well as to individual developers. 

The Elite development team is available for assistance if you have any issues regarding these criteria.


## Code Format

-	There should only be one code command per line. 
-	Keep the space between code blocks at two lines.

## Code Scope

-	Classes that have just default constructor values should use default constructors. 
-	Use the keyword "final" unless it pertains to constants.


## Other Code-Related Information

-	Each variable's name should have meant and be pertinent to its intended use. 
-	There should be a brief statement describing the purpose of each group or block of code.


### Developing Secure Software

Although it might not be the most thrilling aspect of writing code, it is imperative to take security threats into account. Analyzing security risks should start early in the project and continue all the way through to conclusion.

-	Learn about the security threats related to the project's components. 
-	Steers clear of depending just on default configurations and software that comes with the box. 

### Which Programming Language Should I Use?

Regarding programming languages, we don't have any hard regulations. We use JS, CSS, PHP, and HTML now, however we're open to changes for better project outcomes.

### Code Comments

-	Comments on the code should provide an explanation for its actions. 
-	Make sure your indentation is standardized.
-	Make use of the horizontal whitespace (code blocks and paragraphs). 
-	Don't write lines that are longer than 75–80 characters.


## Using the bug Tracker

The recommended method for reporting issues, asking for features, and making pull requests is the bug tracker.

### Feature Requests

-	Make sure the objectives and scope of the project align with your idea.
-	Make a strong argument to argue in favor of the feature.

### Requests for Pulls

-	Good pull requests include patches, upgrades, and new features.
-	Aim for focused pull requests and steer clear of irrelevant commits.
-	Before you begin, find out the scope of the pull request from a maintainer.

### Bug Report

Include:

- Title: Concise and precise. 
- Summary: In-depth justification is provided. 
- Visual evidence: Video or screenshots are provided. 
- Expected versus actual result: succinct and direct. 
- Reproducible steps: Steps that caused the bug. 
- Environment: OS, browser, screen resolution, and zoom degree. 
- Log from the console: Find the source of the issue. 
- URL of the source: To rapidly determine the problem. 
- Priority and severity: The degree of impact and the urgency of the investigation. 
- Name of the reporter, recipient, deadline, and exchange with the customer or user.

Create a report using this data and send it to elite.github@gmail.com for support.

# Documentation

As previously indicated under the development status, the website's complete documentation is currently unavailable because it is still in the early stages of development for an open-source project that is just getting started. On the other hand, you must possess a reasonable level of technical proficiency to contribute to our project, especially in web development and server configuration. Setting up Elite locally using XAMPP entails cloning the repository, configuring Apache and MySQL, and establishing a new database in phpMyAdmin if you're comfortable with version control systems like Git. The config.php file needs to have the database credentials updated. Frontend design is dependent on frameworks like Bootstrap, while navigating and modifying the backend logic requires a little familiarity of PHP. Although the instructions walk you through the procedure, exploring and modifying Elite's frontend will be simpler for users who have some familiarity with JavaScript, HTML, PHP, and CSS (particularly Bootstrap). In general, users will find it easier to traverse the setup and customization if they have a basic familiarity of web programming fundamentals.
